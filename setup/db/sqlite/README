All of the scripts in this database are designed to be mapped to a
blank database and are NOT upgrade scripts. They WILL fail if tables
exist with the same name.

* Summary of Tables:
  
  - configuration :: A database of the administrator-defined
                     customization data. Administrators should use the
                     appropriate interface but reading and writing to
                     the database is not a problem.
  - passwords :: a userid foreign-keyed table that maps userids to
                 their appropriate pwhash, which in this case is a
                 SHA-1 representation.
  - users :: a user-id primary keyed table which holds the username,
             user id and email.
  - usersessions :: This is related to the session management
                    component of the web frontend. It relies heavily
                    on [[http://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.html][Python's UUID]], but any database backend should
                    manage and mitigate possible UUID collisions
                    because they can and will occur.
